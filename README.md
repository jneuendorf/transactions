# transactions

A registry of atomic operations and their inverse functions. They can be run as a transaction.

While searching for a free package name if found that this package is pretty similar to [node-transactions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-transactions).
But the state is entirely handled by the user (as opposed to the `context` of `node-transactions`).
